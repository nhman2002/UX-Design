# Overview

As documented in the aforementioned report PA#2, the primary problem that we are facing is the difficulty of finding enough members to participate in a sport match. Moreover, the lack of information about the match also makes it difficult for users to decide whether to join.

Throughout the timeline of the report, we have conducted several brainstroming sessions to fomulate and refine all the potential solutions to resolve the problem. Provided with the problem statement, we have had several shallow researches on the existing solutions and their pros and cons, and have gathered inspiration from any resources available out there to construct in order to make at least 3 potential solutions.

# Aim

The aim of this report is to document the process of brainstorming ideas and the prototyping of the potential solutions. Moreover, we aimed to document evaluative data from the formative testing procedures conducted on the several selected users.

Our main criteria for the evaluation are:

- Practicality, that is, the solution should be able to be implemented in the real world, with the existing technology stack.
- Usability, that is, the solution should be easy to use and fairly intuitive for the users.
- Accessibility, that is, the solution should be accessible to the users via some means, e.g. mobile app, web app, etc.
