# Abstract

This usability testing report presents the findings and insights derived from a comprehensive evaluation of the user experience of our high fidelity prototype: **The Traditional-styled Mobile Application**, which we have came to finalization based on the data of our previous prototypes testing and have been documented in the previous report.

The results of this usability testing provide actionable recommendations for user interface improvements, feature enhancements, and potential iterations to create a more intuitive and engaging platform. The insights gained from this evaluation will guide future design and development efforts to align the design more closely with user needs and preferences, ultimately increasing user adoption, participation, and satisfaction.

# Objective

The goal of our testing was to see how users interact with our interface. We really wanted to see if the interface was intuitive for users, if they understood what they needed to do to accomplish the tasks. We also used the user testing to find better and more intuitive ways to do things and to have the overall data to back up our design decisions, as well as to find any usability issues that we may have missed.

# Participants

Based on the goals of this study, we conducted the testing with 3 groups of participants, which are:

- Advanced Users: People who are familiar and comfortable with technology and/or have a background in technology or technology-related fields.
- Intermediate Users: People who are familiar with a wide range of digital tools and applications and may use technology regularly in their personal and professional lives, but do not have a background in technology or technology-related fields.
- Novice Users: People with basic knowledge and skills in performing tasks on digital tools and applications.

Due to the limit of time and resources, we limited the scope of participants to people who we know, and we also asked them to recommend their friends and family to participate in the testing. We also asked them to recommend people from different age groups, so that we can have a diverse range of participants.

There were 3 participants in total, all were tested in person with the same testing protocol:

|              | Participant 1 | Participant 2 | Participant 3     |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Name         | Thanh Hien    | Quang Thinh   | Minh Truong       |
| Gender       | Female        | Male          | Male              |
| Age          | 21            | 23            | 21                |
| Background   | Law Major     | Manager       | Software Engineer |
| Type of user | Novice        | Intermediate  | Advanced          |
| Interviewer  | Huynh Man     | Vinh Trung    | Huynh Man         |

# Evaluation

## Prerequisites

Since the prototype is a mobile application, we want to test it on a mobile device. Prior to the test, we made sure that the demo of the prototype is properly configured and ready to be tested, and it should be able to carry the main funcationalities of the application. We also made sure that the prototype run smoothly on our devices.

## Methods

One crucial aspect of our evaluation methods is ensuring the conduction of tests within a controlled environment. This strategy enables us to gain comprehensive insights into participants' actions and thought processes. To further foster candid feedback, we prioritize participant comfort and relaxation during testing. Given these considerations, we opted for in-person testing over remote methods. In-person testing allows us to exert greater control over the environment and participants' interactions, facilitating rapport-building and a deeper understanding of their experiences.

We used a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate our solution, which can be summarized as follows:

- **Controlled Observation**: We closely observed participants as they interacted with the prototype in person. By documenting their actions, challenges, moments of confusion, and errors encountered, we aim to gain profound insights. These insights, we believe, will pave the way for refining the prototype's design and elevating user experiences.
- **Tasks-based and Time Completion Testing**: We asked participants to perform a series of tasks on the prototype. The tasks were designed to evaluate the prototype’s usability and effectiveness. We also asked the participants to think aloud as they were performing the tasks, so that we can understand their thought process and the reasoning behind their actions. We also recorded the time taken by participants to complete specific tasks and compare this with predefined benchmarks or alternative methods to evaluate the prototype’s efficiency.
- **System Usability Scale (SUS)**: We used the SUS to measure the participants’ overall satisfaction with the prototype. The SUS is a 10-item questionnaire with a 5-point Likert scale response format. We also included open-ended questions in the questionnaire, so that the participants can provide more detailed feedback about their experience with the prototype.

All of the tests are recorded so that we can review the tests later and analyze the data more thoroughly.

# Metrics

Our evaluation approach centers around the assessment of our solution across three key criteria: **Effectiveness**, **Efficiency**, and **Satisfaction**. This triad of factors collectively informs our understanding of the solution's performance.

Post-interview, we consolidate the data and catalog it within the report. This documentation involves not only data presentation but also a blend of analyses, interpretations, and speculative insights to bridge any informational gaps. Considering the constraints imposed by time limitations and participant availability, we acknowledge that the degree of accuracy in our user study might be slightly compromised. Nevertheless, the insights garnered from this approach are sufficiently robust to fuel substantive discussions for future developmental directions.

## Effectiveness Assessment

- Task Success: A task was deemed successful if the participant was able to accomplish it. If a participant chose to abandon a task, it was classified as a failure. In cases where a participant strayed from the optimal path but still managed to complete the task, it was considered a success.
- Completion Rate: We calculated success and failure rates as percentages. This quantitative measure provided insights into the success ratio of tasks and the overall performance of the prototype.
- Error Tracking: Any deviations or disruptions during task execution were documented as errors. An error was identified as an action that impeded the seamless completion of a task.
- Assistance Instances: Instances where participants were given hints or clues during significant confusion were noted. These moments of assistance helped us gauge the extent to which users required guidance.

## Efficiency Assessment

- Time On Task: We tracked the duration of each task, starting from the moment a participant initiated the task to its completion. The average task time was calculated both on a per-task basis and at an individual level. Additionally, we computed the standard deviation of these time measurements.

## Satisfaction Assessment

- SUS (System Usability Scale): Post-test, we administered the SUS questionnaire to participants to gauge their overall satisfaction with the prototype.

## Materials and Tools

### Observation Form

This form is used to record the participants' actions and thoughts during the test. It is used to record the participants' actions and thoughts during the test. It has some predefined fields to record the participants' actions and thoughts, and also some predefined tasks for the participants to perform.

### Task Instruction Sheet

This sheet is used to instruct the participants on what they need to do during the test. We included the tasks that we want the participants to perform on the prototype.

### Post-test Questionnaire

This questionnaire is used to collect the participants' feedback on the prototype. It includes the SUS questionnaire and some open-ended questions for the participants to provide more detailed feedback.

### Timer

We used a timer to record the time taken by the participants to complete the tasks.

### Tools

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/): We used Figma to create the prototype.
- [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/): We used Google Forms to create the post-task and post-test questionnaire and have the participants fill it out.

# Procedure

## Pre-test

- Setup equipment: All the equipment needed for the test are prepared and ready to be used, i.e. mobile phone, computer, camera, etc.
- Sheet preparation: The observation sheets, task instruction sheets, and post-test questionnaire are prepared and ready to be used.
- The moderator record the participants' actions and save the recording on their computer.

## Test

1. Introduction: We introduced ourselves to the participants and explained the purpose of the test.
2. The test was conducted by our team members in their desired locations, but we made sure that the environment is comfortable and quiet enough for the participants to focus on the test.
3. Moderator handed the participants the task instructions.
4. Moderator provided assists when participants needed it.
5. Moderator starts the timer when the participants start performing the tasks and stops the timer when the participants finish performing the tasks.
6. Moderator asks the participants to fill out the post-task questionnaire after each task.

## Post-test

- Moderator asks the participants to fill out the SUS questionnaire.
- Gather data and run analysis.

# Results

Some of the participants' comments are translated from Vietnamese to English for better understanding, given that the test was conducted in Vietnamese.

## Summary of overall findings

Overall the application is quite intuitive and easy to use, and they described the application as "a modern and easy to use application". Given that the tests were conducted in a *not-so-professional* matter, the participants sometimes ignored the instructions and what we said, and sometimes wandered around the application and did not know what to do at first, but they quickly figured out what to do and how to do it.

Despite the minor drawbacks, the participants were able to complete the tasks with ease, and they were able to provide us with valuable feedback on the application. However, there are some drawbacks that we need to address (implicit and explicit):

- The participants thought that the application should support more languages, especially Vietnamese, since the participants are not comfortable with English. 
- The participants found it hard to find the "My match" screen, which was potentially due to the fact that the icon for that screen is not intuitive enough.
- The participants also had some trouble navigating the application. This might be due to the fact that there are not enough visual cues to guide the users such as breadcrumbs, icons, etc.

## Performance data

Time on task might not be the best metric to evaluate the performance of the application and not the 100% accurate metric, since the prototypes are not fully functional and there are some tasks that the participants cannot perform. However, we still recorded the time taken by the participants to complete the tasks for reference.

### Task 1: Find a match missing 3 members and apply to that match

| Participant | Task Success | Time On Task (s) | Assists | Errors |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------- | ------ |
| 1           | Yes          | 5.71             | 0       | 0      |
| 2           | Yes          | 7.14             | 0       | 0      |
| 3           | Yes          | 4.67             | 0       | 0      |

Findings:

- Participants seem to have difficult finding where to view the detailed information of the author of the match.
- There should be a "Search" button to find the desired matches.

Participant Comments:

- Participant 1:
  - "There's no swimming or volleyball?"
  - "Well it was pretty easy"
- Participant 2:
  - "There should've been a search button on the top bar here to find the matches. If not then I don't know how far I have to scroll to find the match that I want."
  - "Overall, it was pretty easy to find the match."
- Participant 3:
  - "I found it pretty simple to find the match since on login screen, there is a list of matches that I can choose from."
  - "I think that it's pretty easy to find the information of the author, but there should be a plus button or some sort displayed on the author card."
### Task 2: Create a match

| Participant | Task Success | Time On Task (s) | Assists | Errors |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------- | ------ |
| 1           | Yes          | 26.14            | 1       | 2      |
| 2           | Yes          | 16.06            | 1       | 0      |
| 3           | Yes          | 11.14            | 0       | 0      |

Findings:

- Some participant had trouble finding the "Create" button.

Participant Comments:

- Participant 1:
  - "The information inputs are enough"
  - "There should be a way to add a specific audience target (from what age to what age) for the match."

  - "I think the information inputs are enough"
  - "I press this plus sign here?"
- Participant 3:
  - "It's easy"
  - "The layout looks pretty nice and modern"
  - "I find the information inputs are enough since that's all the information that I need to create a match."

### Task 3: Find the candidates who applied to your match and approve them

| Participant | Task Success | Time On Task (s) | Assists | Errors |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------- | ------ |
| 1           | Yes          | 48.58            | 1       | 3      |
| 2           | Yes          | 28.27            | 0       | 1      |
| 3           | Yes          | 31.41            | 0       | 0      |

Findings:

- The whole process of approving candidates is quite confusing and time-consuming.
- Screen switching is quite a hassle and may not be necessary.
- Title of the screen should be clearer and more readable.
- The "My Match" icon is not intuitive enough.

Participant Comments:

- Participant 1:
  - "How do I find the candidates?"
  - "This is the My Profile screen, right?"
  - "It's not easy at all"
  - "Is this the My Match screen?"
  - "The font should be bigger and bold. The icon for the My Match should be different"
- Participant 2:
  - "I think the information of candidates should be placed right at the bottom of the match detail screen so that I can see it right away without having to go through multiple screens."
  - "I find it a bit annoying."
- Participant 3:
  - "I think it's ok"
  - "I think all the steps taken are necessary, although it does take a bit of screen transitioning to get to the candidates' information."
  - "There should be a tutorial for new users. I'm fine but it just takes time to get used to at first."

### Task 4: Find your contacts and chat with any 1 person

| Participant | Task Success | Time On Task (s) | Assists | Errors |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------- | ------ |
| 1           | Yes          | 4.65             | 0       | 0      |
| 2           | Yes          | 2.69             | 0       | 0      |
| 3           | Yes          | 3.79             | 0       | 0      |

Findings:

- There should be a way to create a group chat to chat with multiple people at once, instead of having to chat with each person individually.
- There should be a way to send images and other media files.
- The search button should be at the top bar.

Participant Comments:

- Participant 1:
  - "Here, this one I can find it."
  - "It's like Facebook add friend function"
  - "I think the search button should be at the top bar."
  - "I think like we should have like a priority list of people that we chat with the most."
- Participant 2:
  - "There should be an icon, send images like Messenger"
  - "I think we should place the search button on the top bar, it's more convenient."
  - "I think we should be able to create a group chat to chat with multiple people at once."
- Participant 3:
  - "I think the messenging function is necessary for when we have other things to talk about related to the match"
  - "The search button should be placed on the top bar. The current position is not convenient since when the list gets longer, it may covers the list."
  - "The search button should hide when the user scrolls down the list."
  - "Deleting messages should be a thing."

## Performance data analysis

- Partipant 1 and 2 took a noticeably longer time to complete the tasks compared to participant 3. This might be due to the fact that participant 3 is an advanced user, while participant 1 and 2 are intermediate and novice users respectively.
- Participant 1 was the only participant that needed the most assists and made the most errors.
- All participants stated that the application is quite easy to use and intuitive, but there are some minor drawbacks that need to be addressed.
- There should be a tutotial for new users to get used to the application.

## SUS

The SUS questionnaire was filled out by the participants after the test. Formula: **(Sum of Odd - 5) + (25 - Sum of Even) x 2.5**
The results are as follows:


| Participant | SUS Score |
| ----------- | --------- |
| 1           | 67.5      |
| 2           | 75        |
| 3           | 77.5      |
| Mean        | 73.33     |
| Std. Dev.   | 5.77      |

- Participant 1: The SUS score is 67.5, which is considered "OK" according to the SUS score interpretation. The participant commented that the application is quite easy to use, but there are some minor drawbacks that need to be addressed. Overall the participant is satisfied with the application.
- Participant 2 and 3: The SUS score is 75 and 77.5, which is considered "Good" according to the SUS score interpretation. They commented that the application is quite easy to use, with the interface perceived as modern and intuitive. Overall, the participants are satisfied with the application.

The average SUS score is 73.33, which is considered "Good" according to the SUS score interpretation. We can conclude that the participants are satisfied with the application. However these numbers are not 100% accurate for the following reasons:

- The total number of participants is too small (3 in total), which is not enough to represent the whole population.
- The tests are conducted in a *not-so-professional* manner, which may affect the results.
- The prototypes are not fully functional, which may affect the time taken by the participants to complete the tasks.

Despite the drawbacks, we can still use the SUS score as a reference to evaluate the application. In conclusion, we can say that the participants are satisfied with the application.
