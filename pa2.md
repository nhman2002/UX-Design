# Abstract

Sports have become an essential, such that everyone should be encouraged to do it because of the benefits it brings to the body. Team-oriented games are the options that people could take to enjoy sports activites. We cannot deny the fact that there are still people who are willing to come out and do sports in a group. However, for most of the time, people do not have enough members to conduct sports activities. This situation can lead to discouragement and stopping them from doing any more sports activities due to the insufficient number of members.

Therefore, we are proposing a mobile application that can facilitate the process of finding members to play sports together. This application will be able to match people with the same interests and sports activities. It will also be able to provide a platform for people to communicate and arrange the time and place to play sports together. We hope that by doing this, we can encourage more people to do sports and participate more in sports activities as well as to promote a healthy lifestyle.

# Purposes

The purpose of this report is to understand and gain insights into the user's data such as their context, environment, goals, problems, needs, etc. with respect to the problem domain, in order to better understand the users as well as to evaluate and generate potential solution ideas to the problem. Moreover, these research information will help to assess the feasibility of the proposed solution and to indentify potential problems that may arise during the development of the solution. 

# Scope

The research will be conducted, mainly but not limited to, university students who are interested in sports activities. The scope is planned to be in such a way for the following factors:

- We think that university students are more likely to be interested in sports activities as they are still young and energetic, though might suffer from the lack of members due to various reasons, for instance, they are new to the university and do not know many people yet, and/or some might have different schedules and are not able to play sports together.
- We think that university students are more likely to be willing to try out new things, such as a new mobile application, and are more likely to provide feedbacks and suggestions for improvement.
- Since we are also university students, we are more likely to understand the problems that university students are facing and are more likely to come up with solutions that are more suitable for university students.

With the above reasons, though restricted to university students, we believe that the research will be able to provide sufficient information and insights.

# Summary

The report details and analyzes a series of user research methods conducted for assessment of the problem domain. The research methods include:

- Online survey: to gather an overall understanding of the data and to identify the problems that the users are facing.
- Interview: specifically, semi-structured interview, to gain insights into more detailed information about the users on the problem.
- Fly on the wall: observation real-life situations of some common sports activities to gain insights into the users' context and environment.
