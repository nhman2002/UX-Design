# Abstract

Sports have become an essential, such that everyone should be encouraged to do it because of the benefits it brings to the body. Team-oriented games are the options that people could take to enjoy sports activites. We cannot deny the fact that there are still people who are willing to come out and do sports in a group. However, for most of the time, people do not have enough members to conduct sports activities. This situation can lead to discouragement and stopping them from doing any more sports activities due to the insufficient number of members.

Therefore, we are proposing a mobile application that can facilitate the process of finding members to play sports together. This application will be able to match people with the same interests and sports activities. It will also be able to provide a platform for people to communicate and arrange the time and place to play sports together. We hope that by doing this, we can encourage more people to do sports and participate more in sports activities as well as to promote a healthy lifestyle.

# Purposes

The purpose of this report is to understand and gain insights into the user's data such as their context, environment, goals, problems, needs, etc. with respect to the problem domain, in order to better understand the users as well as to evaluate and generate potential solution ideas to the problem. Moreover, these research information will help to assess the feasibility of the proposed solution and to indentify potential problems that may arise during the development of the solution. 

# Scope

The research will be conducted, mainly but not limited to, university students who are interested in sports activities. The scope is planned to be in such a way for the following factors:

- We think that university students are more likely to be interested in sports activities as they are still young and energetic, though might suffer from the lack of members due to various reasons, for instance, they are new to the university and do not know many people yet, and/or some might have different schedules and are not able to play sports together.
- We think that university students are more likely to be willing to try out new things, such as a new mobile application, and are more likely to provide feedbacks and suggestions for improvement.
- Since we are also university students, we are more likely to understand the problems that university students are facing and are more likely to come up with solutions that are more suitable for university students.

With the above reasons, though restricted to university students, we believe that the research will be able to provide sufficient information and insights.

# Limitations

## Limitation 1: Sample size

Our group interviewed X people. Our client’s user size ranges from Y-Z per day depending on the month (for example, holiday months are much busier than non-holiday months). Therefore, X people is most likely not an accurate representation of Collage.com’s users.

## Limitation 2: Sample Selection

Our interview participants were not randomly selected. We asked people we knew, such as classmates and friends, because they were easy to access. In order to be truly random, we could have generated a list of all our classmates, got rid of those not in our target demographic, and then randomly selected people from that list. However, this would have been time consuming and difficult to do.

## Limitation 3: Problem Scope

The problem we are analyzing is also limited. It was somewhat difficult to create interview questions that would help us understand more about this problem without asking our participants specific usability problems or showing them the appplication. Since this phase was not concerned about an applications specific usability issues, we asked more general questions but perhaps did not receive as much as insight to the problem as we would have liked. 

# Summary

The report details and analyzes a series of user research methods conducted for assessment of the problem domain. The research methods include:

- Online survey: to gather an overall understanding of the data and to identify the problems that the users are facing.
- Interview: specifically, semi-structured interview, to gain insights into more detaiSled information about the users on the problem.
- Fly on the wall: observation real-life situations of some common sports activities to gain insights into the users' context and environment.

## Key findings

### Key findings 1

- **Lack of Members**: The primary concern expressed by users is the difficulty in finding enough members to participate in sports activities. Many respondents mentioned that they often face challenges in forming complete teams, leading to canceled or postponed games.
- **Recommendation**: The application should focus on facilitating the process of finding members for sports activities. It should provide a platform for users to connect with like-minded individuals and form teams for their preferred sports.

### Key findings 2

- **Preference for Football**: Among the various sports activities, football emerged as the most popular choice among users. 
- **Recommendation**: The application should prioritize football-related activities and provide features that cater to the needs of football enthusiasts. This could help attract more users and increase participation rates. It is evident that a significant portion of potential participants is interested in football-related events.

### Key findings 3

- **Time and Schedule Constraints**: Users often struggle to coordinate schedules and find suitable time slots that accommodate everyone's availability (Conflicting academic or work,...)
- **Recommendation**: Schedule coordination is a critical aspect of sports activity planning. The application should provide a smart scheduling system that considers users' availability and constraints to suggest suitable time slots for sports activities. This could minimize conflicts and improve participation rates.

### Key findings 4

- **Communication**: Users emphasized the importance of efficient communication within the sports groups. 
- **Recommendation**: An ideal solution should facilitate easy coordination, notifications, and updates to ensure smooth sports activity planning.

# Methods

To obtain the above findings, the following research methods were employed:

## 1. Online Survey: 

An online survey was designed and conducted to gather quantitative data and gain an overall understanding of the users' perspectives on sports activities. The survey was distributed to a targeted group of university students who expressed an interest in sports. The survey consisted of structured questions covering the following key aspects:
- *What sports do you like to play?*<br>
This question aimed to identify the various sports activities that respondents were interested in engaging in. It allowed researchers to understand the diversity of sports preferences among the target audience.
- *How many times a week do you play that sport?*<br>
The frequency of sports participation provided insights into the level of interest and dedication of respondents towards their preferred sports activities. It helped gauge the enthusiasm for regular sports engagement.
- *How many hours per game?*<br>
This question sought to understand the typical duration of sports games or activities that respondents participated in. It helped assess the time commitment required for each sports session.
- *What do you usually prepare before playing, and how do you plan for sports activities? (e.g., choosing a place, inviting friends, renting equipment)*<br>
This open-ended question aimed to capture the pre-game preparations and planning strategies of respondents. It provided insights into the typical steps taken by participants to organize sports activities and gather necessary resources.
- *Do you have any difficulties in preparing and planning for sports activities? If yes, please elaborate.* <br>
This question focused on identifying the specific challenges faced by respondents when preparing for and planning sports activities. It allowed participants to express any obstacles they encountered in the process.

- *What issues do you care about in the process of playing that sport? (e.g., safety, competitiveness, sportsmanship)*<br>
The purpose of this question was to understand the concerns and priorities of respondents during the sports activity itself. It aimed to identify the aspects that participants valued and considered important while playing the sport.

# TODO: Survey link

## 2. Semi-Structured Interviews: 

To gain deeper insights into the users' experiences and to explore their motivations, challenges, and needs regarding sports activities, semi-structured interviews were conducted with selected survey participants. The participants for interviews were purposefully chosen to include individuals with diverse sports interests and varying levels of engagement.

The interviews were conducted in a one-on-one format, allowing participants to express their thoughts and experiences openly. The interview questions were designed to be open-ended, encouraging participants to share their perspectives freely. The following topics were covered during the interviews:

- **Motivations and Interests**: Participants were asked about their motivations for participating in sports activities and their specific interests in particular sports.

- **Challenges Faced**: The interviews explored the challenges and barriers participants encountered in forming teams and organizing sports events.

- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Participants were encouraged to provide suggestions and ideas for a potential solution to address the issue of finding members for sports activities.

The semi-structured interviews provided rich qualitative data that complemented the quantitative findings from the online survey.

For the interview questions, please refer to [Appendix B](#appendix-b-interview-question-scripts).

## 3. Still-photo survey: 

We asked users to send their own photo of their preparation for sports activities. The purpose of this survey is to acquire more information about the users' preparation for sports activities.

Above are some examples of the photos that we received from the users. From the photos, we can see that most of the users are preparing for football activities. This is consistent with the result from the online survey. We can also see that the problem most of the users are facing is the lack of members. This is also consistent with the result from the data we collected.
