### 2.5.2. Efficiency

#### Good Points

**Navigation Speed:**: Players can quickly navigate through menus, settings, and in-game interfaces to access various features and options (such as where to start the match, friend list, shops, battle pass, ...). Everything is scattered around the edge of the screen to give your in-game character the highlight. Also,  there is always an Exit button on the top right to undo action and exit the dialogue.

![pubg-image-4](images/pubg-navigation.png)

**Effective Looting and Inventory Management:**

Players can easily perform actions such as swapping items between their inventory and the ground, dropping items from their inventory, or picking up items from the ground with the auto-pickup feature. Players just need to tap on the item they want to pick up and the item will be automatically added to their inventory. The auto-pickup feature can be customized to prioritize certain items over others, allowing players to quickly collect the items they need.


PUBG Mobile typically offers options to sort and filter the inventory based on different criteria such as item type, rarity, and quantity. This helps players quickly find and manage specific items.

-	**Solution:** Customizable Controller Interface
To enhance the user experience, a potential solution is to provide users with the ability to customize their controller interface. By allowing users to personalize the placement and number of buttons according to their preferences and gameplay style, the interaction space can be optimized. However, it should be noted that customization may result in the transfer of the problem to other aspects, as reducing buttons may limit certain movements or actions.

![pubg-fingers](images/pubg-fingers.jpg)

**Load-time and Matchmaking:**

The time it takes to find a match in each map in PUBG MOBILE can vary depending on several factors, including the region, time of day, and the player’s rank. On average, it typically takes around 30 seconds to a few minutes to find a match in popular maps such as Erangel, Miramar, Sanhok, and Vikendi. However, less popular or newer maps may take longer to find a match. Additionally, the time it takes to find a match can vary depending on the player’s rank. Higher-ranked players may experience longer matchmaking times due to the smaller pool of players available at their skill level.

**Lag and Frame Rate Issues:**


Lag and frame rate issues can occur in PUBG MOBILE due to a variety of factors, including network connectivity, device performance, and graphics settings. These issues can negatively impact the user experience by causing delays in gameplay, making it difficult to aim accurately, or resulting in crashes or disconnections.

This means that similar actions and interactions are represented in a uniform way across different screens and menus. For example, the placement of buttons, icons, and menu structures remain consistent, making it easier for users to remember how to navigate and interact within the game.

- **Help and Support:** The game offers in-game help and support features, including tooltips, prompts, and contextual information. These resources can aid players in refreshing their memory on specific features or mechanics when needed.

- **Personalized Settings:** PUBG MOBILE allows users to customize their settings, including controls, sensitivity, and UI elements. By giving players the ability to tailor the game experience to their preferences, it increases memorability as they can configure the game to match their individual playstyle and needs.

![pubg-settings](images/pubg-settings.png)

- **Visual Cues and Feedback:** PUBG MOBILE incorporates visual cues and feedback to reinforce actions and provide information to the player. This can include highlighting interactive elements, displaying status indicators, and providing visual and audio feedback when actions are performed successfully. These cues help users remember the effects of their actions and understand the outcome of their interactions.

- **Visual Hierarchy:** PUBG MOBILE applies visual hierarchy to highlight important elements and information. By using size, color, contrast, and spacing effectively, the interface guides users' attention to key elements, making them more memorable and easier to locate and interact with in the future.

By focusing on consistent design patterns, intuitive controls, helpful onboarding, personalized settings, visual cues, and feedback, PUBG MOBILE aims to enhance the memorability of the user interface.
