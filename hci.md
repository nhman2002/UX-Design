### **Drawbacks**:

  - **Learning Curve**: Due to its unconventional interface, users may initially find it challenging to understand how to read the time on the CELESTE. It deviates from the traditional watch face format, requiring users to learn a new time-telling method. This learning curve can be a drawback for users who prefer familiarity and ease of use.
  _Use case_: Elderly users who are accustomed to traditional watch designs and may have difficulty adapting to new technologies could find the learning curve of the CELESTE challenging. Its unconventional interface might cause confusion and frustration for individuals who are used to reading time in a more traditional manner.
    ![Howto_Celeste](images/Howto_Celeste.jpg)

  - **Precision and Accuracy**: The abstract representation of time on the CELESTE sacrifices precise timekeeping. The absence of minute and second markers makes it difficult to determine time with high accuracy. While the watch may suffice for general timekeeping, it may not be suitable for situations that require precise timing.
  _Use case_: Sports and fitness enthusiasts who require precise timing for activities such as interval training, timing laps, or monitoring rest periods may find the abstract time representation of the CELESTE insufficient.

    ![eclipse-steel-black-red](images/ziiiro_celeste_mono_on_hand.jpg)
    
  - **Limited Functionality**: The CELESTE interface focuses solely on displaying the time. It lacks additional features commonly found in modern watches, such as date display, alarms, or timers. Users who require these functionalities may find the CELESTE limited in its capabilities.
  _Use case_: Travelers who rely on watches to not only tell time but also track multiple time zones or use alarms to manage their schedules may find the limited functionality of the CELESTE inconvenient. The absence of additional features like date display, world time, or alarms may hinder their ability to efficiently manage their travel plans or stay organized in different time zones.
   ![lunar-black](images/maxresdefault.jpg)

  - **Accessibility**: The abstract representation of time on the CELESTE may pose challenges for individuals with visual impairments or certain cognitive disabilities. The lack of clear, standardized time indicators can hinder accessibility for a portion of the user population.
  _Use case_: Visually impaired users who heavily rely on tactile or audible feedback to interact with devices may find the abstract time representation of the CELESTE inaccessible. The lack of clear indicators or tactile markings makes it difficult for these users to independently read and interpret the time, potentially excluding them from using the watch effectively.
   ![lunar-black](images/CelesteBlackMono24.jpg)

## 1.6. Different types of users

- **Tech Novices**:
  Users who are not accustomed to modern technology or have limited experience with digital devices may face difficulties understanding and operating the CELESTE unconventional interface. The abstract representation of time may be confusing, leading to a steep learning curve for these users.

  Users with certain cognitive disabilities that affect their ability to interpret abstract representations or learn new interfaces may find it challenging to use the CELESTE. The unconventional time display might pose difficulties for these individuals, potentially limiting their ability to independently read and understand the time.

# 2. PUBG Mobile

## 2.1. Introduction

PUBG Mobile is a free-to-play battle royale video game developed by LightSpeed & Quantum Studio, a division of Tencent Games. It is a mobile game adaptation of PUBG: Battlegrounds. It was initially released for Android and iOS on 19 March 2018.

It was published by multiple publishers in different regions, including Krafton, Tencent, and VNG Games. By December 2022, PUBG Mobile had accumulated around 1.3 billion downloads while grossing over $9 billion, making it the third highest-grossing mobile game. It is also the second most-played mobile video game of all time. In 2021, the game spawned an Indian version, Battlegrounds Mobile India, and a separate game taking place in the PUBG Universe, called New State Mobile. 

![pubg-cover](images/pubg-cover.jpg)

## 2.2. Target Audience

PUBG Mobile is a game that is played by people of all ages. However, the game is rated 17+ by the ESRB and 16+ by PEGI.

## 2.3. Welcome Interface

PUBG Mobile is very strict about the policy and also the restricted age. That is why the developers of the game have to make sure that the players are aware of the rules and regulations of the game. For newcomers, this is the first screen that they will see when they open the game.

![pubg-welcome](images/pubg-welcome.jpg)

![pubg-user-agree](images/pubg-user-agree.jpg)

The notice board is in the foreground and is centered on the screen for the player to read. The background is dimmed to a darker color so that it will not cause any distractions (this rule of designing applies to every notice board throughout the game). The buttons are highlighted with a bright color to attract the player's attention with well contrasted font for readability. The buttons are also placed in the bottom center of the screen so that the player can easily reach them with their thumbs.

However, the content of the policy is not very well contrasted with respect to the background, plus the font they use here is not very readable. In addition, the font size is pretty small, and on mobile devices, this will be harder to read. The developers should consider using a different font and font size to make it easier for players to read.

![pubg-age-confirm](images/pubg-age-confirm.jpg)

The game is restricted to players under the age of 17. Therefore, the developers have to make a confirmation for the players age to modify the ingame content accordingly.

## 2.4. Downloaded Content

A good thing to note is that the game will not download all the content at once. When you first install the game from the store, it will only download the necessary data for the game to run. The rest of the content will be downloaded when you first access it. This is a good way to reduce first-time download time and also reduce the amount of data used.

Not to mention, the game also let the players choose between the HD and SD graphics. This allows for more flexibility in the game's performance if players are using low-end devices.

*(Unfortunately, the image was not taken for this interface)*

## 2.5. Typing Interface

The game is developed to be played horizontally, because of this reason, the keyboard is placed at the bottom of the screen for ease of reach. In addition, a special thing about the design of keyboard in this game is that it divides the keyboard into two parts, one for the left hand and one for the right hand. This is a good design choice because it allows the player to use their thumbs more conveniently to type, especially on larger screen devices where the keyboard is too wide for the player to reach the middle of the keyboard.

![pubg-typing](images/pubg-text-typing.jpg)

Here you can see the division part. In addition to this, the distance between the keys is also very well-spaced so that the player can easily tap on the keys without accidentally tapping on the wrong key. Although this might cause some inconvenience for players who are used to typing on a normal keyboard, it is still a good design choice and it will get easier to type once the player gets used to it.

## 2.4. Login Interface

![pubg-login](images/pubg-login.jpg)

The login interface is very simple and straightforward. It provides two methods for players to log in, either by using their Facebook account or by using their Google account. This is a good design choice because it allows players to log in quickly without having to create a new account since these two platforms are very popular and most people already have an account on them.

Plus, the login screen presents the game's logo and the splash screen in the background to catch the player's attention and to enhance the overall visual appeal of the interface.

The screen also has a few buttons on the top-right corner like the "Help" button so that players can easily access the help center if they have any problems with the game, the "Language" button allows players to change the language of the game to fits their needs (the language is default to English because this is the main language spoken and used internationally).

In addition, there is a reminder in the top-left corner which says "Play over 180 minutes a day is bad for your health". This banner will appear throughout the game to remind the players to take a break from the game to avoid any health problems. For some people, this might be annoying since it blocks a part of the screen. However, it will disapear in the main gameplay screen.

## 2.5. Welcome to the Game

![pubg-newbie-welcome](images/pubg-newbie-train.jpg)

For newcomers to the game, it will prompt you to play the training mode to get used to all the controls and the game mechanics. This mode allows users to train their skills, experiment with different weapons and strategies, and gain familiarity with the game's mechanics in a controlled environment. Practice modes contribute to the iterative learning process, enabling players to refine their abilities gradually.

However, the game does not force new players to go straight into training mode. Instead, it allows players to skip the training and play with others in a real battle game. By doing this, the game focuses on the main purpose of the game, a Battle Royale game, which is to survive and be the last one standing. It gives new players the sense of what the game is about and what they should expect throughout the gameplay right of the bat so that they can experience the gameplay as soon as possible, rather than having them to go through all the complex details of the non-essential features.

## Main Lobby

### Overview

![pubg-lobby](images/pubg-lobby.jpg)

The main lobby is the first screen that players see when they open the game. It is where players can access various features, such as the shop, inventory, settings, and social features. The lobby is designed to be visually appealing and intuitive, allowing players to navigate through the interface easily. It also serves as a hub for players to access other game modes, such as training, arcade, and classic matches.

There are 3 main sections in the lobby:

- **Top section**:
  - In the top-left corner, we can see the player's avatar, username, rank, and level. This provides a quick overview of the player's progress and achievements.
  - In the middle, we have the "Home" button (identified by the house icon), the PUBG brand name and the "Shop" button (identified by the shopping cart icon). The "Home" button allows players to return to the main lobby screen, while the "Shop" button allows players to access the in-game store. If there are any new items available for purchase, an exclamation mark will appear next to the "Shop" button to notify players. 
  - In the top-right corner, we have the points and ingame top-ups. The points are used to purchase items in the shop, while the ingame top-ups are used to purchase items in the in-game store. The "Plus" button (identified by the plus icon) shows that players can purchase more top-ups if they want to.
- **Middle section**: 
  - This is the main area of the lobby. We can see the actual background of ingame environment here. Our character model will be in the center, giving us the highlight of the equipments and/or inventory that we're having. Besides, when there are new people join in the game with us, their model will appear next to ours. This allows players to see their teammates and interact with them (via microphone or ingame chat system) before the match starts. It also provides a sense of community and camaraderie, which can enhance the overall user experience.
  - In addition, the game draws inspiration from real-world military tactics, weapons, and equipment. This allows players to leverage their existing knowledge and understanding of these concepts to improve their performance in the game. For example, players can apply real-world knowledge of weapon characteristics, such as recoil and bullet drop, to improve their aim and accuracy in PUBG Mobile.

![image-pubg-2](images/pubg-realworld.png)

- **Bottom section**:
  - The first thing that hits our eyes is the big "Start" button, displayed in a bright yellow color. This aims to attract out attention and to encourage us to start the game (which is the intention of the developers).
  - A special thing about the design of this section is that they don't put everything at once, since it will make the screen look crowded and overwhelming. Instead, they only show the buttons that are important and most relevant to the players. For example, if the player is in the lobby, they will only show the "Missions" button, "Inventory" button. Other options can be found when players click the "Arrow Up" button next to the side. This allows players to focus on the main features of the game without being distracted by unnecessary details.

### Interaction

The lobby is designed with the intention to be simple and intuitive. Most of the time, mobile devices would often have small screens, this would scale down the size of the buttons (for the sake of designing). Noticing this, the developers of the game implemented a feature that allows players to swipe, to the left or to the right, to switch between different screens of the lobby (like the Inventory or the Shop). There is also a transition animation to make the switch more smooth and visually appealing

## Hints and Tips

For new players, who will be unfamiliar with the layout and the functionality of the buttons, the game provides hints to guide them through the interface. 

![pubg-hint](images/pubg-hint.jpg)

For example, when players first open the game, a hint will appear on the "Start" button to encourage them to start the game, or in the picture below, there's a hint pointing at the "Newbie" button,

![pubg-hint](images/pubg-newbie-hints.jpg)

or various banners that appear throughout the game to notify players of new features or events.

![pubg-banner](images/pubg-banner-1.jpg)

These notifications will usually take up most of the screen to catch the player's attention, notifying them of new features or events. For instance, the shop will present latest items that are available for purchase as the main spotlight of the screen, while the background is dimmed so that it will not cause any distractions. Other items are also designed to be well contrasted and visually appealing to attract the player's attention, and potentially, to encourage them to purchase the items.

![pubg-shop](images/pubg-shop.jpg)

Moreover, the game also have popup notifications that appear when players complete a mission or an achievement. Or, when the players accidentally click on "dangerous" buttons, like the "Buy" button in the shop, or the "Upgrade" button in the inventory, or when the players want to exit the match, there will be a popup notification to confirm their action. This thoroughness is a good design to reduce the amount of errors that players might make.

![pubg-exit-match](images/pubg-exit-match.jpg)


## Visualization

The game comes with visual effects to enhance the user experience. For instance, when players want to view the details of an item, there will be a 3D model next to the side to give the players a more realistic view of the item, how it looks like, how it fits to their character models, etc. The 3D model also has the ability to rotate, allowing players to view the item from different angles. This feature is another special thing about the game because they can view all the perks and details of the item right in the game itself, instead of having to go online for reference.

![pubg-visualize](images/pubg-visualization.jpg)

## Personalization

The ingame settings are rich and diverse, allowing players to customize the game to their liking. For example, players can adjust the graphics quality, frame rate, and resolution to optimize performance. They can also customize the controls, button layout, sensitivity, crosshair, and other gameplay settings to suit their preferences. These personalization options allow players to tailor the game, and increases memorability as they can configure the game to match their individual playstyle and needs.

![pubg-settings-1](/images/pubg-settings-1.jpg)

![pubg-settings-2](/images/pubg-settings-2.jpg)

There is one thing to consider, however, is that the personalization options cannot fit all the players' needs. The developers have tried their best to include the most common options that players would want to customize. Doing this will cause an absurd amount of options and it will be unnecessary. An example of this is the limited color options for the crosshair,

![pubg-settings-3](images/pubg-settings-3.jpg)

or the limited languages supported by the game.

![pubg-settings-4](/images/pubg-settings-4.jpg)

## Gameplay

### Loading Screen

![pubg-loading](images/pubg-loading-screen.jpg)

The loading screen is well-thought-out and designed to be visually appealing, while also gives players some insights of the gameplay and the chosen map. For instance, the background is a screenshot of the map environment (dimmed) to give players a sense of the gameplay. In the foreground is a big splashscreen of important mechanics of the game, like the "Danger Zone" or the "Red Zone", visualized with images and text to give players a better ease of understanding. 

Moreover, it also offers tooltips, prompts, and contextual information. These resources can aid players in refreshing their memory on specific features or mechanics when needed.

There is also a loading bar at the bottom of the screen to show the progress of the loading.  



## In-game Experience
### In-game waiting lobby


The game starts when there are 100 available players ready to connect. You can monitor the top-left corner to see the number of players in the room, indicated by an alert line that informs when the game will begin.

![pubg-ingame-lobby](images/pubg-ingame-lobby.jpg)

Once the game starts, the display changes to show the number of players still alive and how many eliminations you have made.

Placing important information in the top-left corner follows a common gaming convention, where crucial details for players to know are located at the top.

Moving to the top-right corner, we find the map along with buttons for settings, microphone access, volume control, and more, depending on personal customization options.

In the middle-top section, there is a minimizable compass. This compass helps players navigate the map and determine the correct direction. Teammates can communicate enemy positions by indicating numbers and cardinal directions (North, South, West, East) using the compass. This feature satisfies `human capabilities` in `perception and cognition`, as well as the `user's mental model`. Furthermore, the usage of a compass, a real-world object, ensures learnability and usability for players.

In the top left corner, the team display shows the four members of our team. Your character is positioned at the top, distinguishing you as the active player, while the others follow below. Each member is tagged with a colored symbol, allowing teammates to be recognized without needing to remember their names. This tagging system takes advantage of `human capabilities`.

At the bottom-right corner, according to the default display, various buttons perform actions such as attack, jump, crawl, and kneel. Each button is accompanied by a clear illustration depicting the specific action. The attack button's appearance changes depending on the type of weapon you are wielding: a fist for no weapon, a bullet for guns, and a knife for melee weapons. Experienced players can easily understand the button's function based on these illustrations, while new players can quickly grasp the usage of the buttons.

The bottom-left corner features a joystick icon for controlling the character. The concept of a joystick is well-known, dating back to the 1960s, making it a familiar control method.

Adjacent to the joystick, there is another attack button. This duplicate button exists for situations when players want to perform simultaneous actions such as jumping and shooting. By pressing the jump button with one thumb and the attack button with the other, players can execute these actions together. This placement of duplicate buttons assists players who may run out of fingers to press buttons on one side. Players have the flexibility to customize their personal action display to suit their preferences.

Next, we have the backpack icon, easily recognizable by its name. The icon also includes a circular loading-like animation, indicating the backpack's storage capacity and whether it is full or has available space. However, players cannot know the exact amount of storage remaining, as a percentage indicator is not provided. Additionally, the backpack icon can display yellow stripes to denote its rarity or tier, with more stripes indicating higher quality.

On the bottom line, there are two weapon slots, two equipment slots (the left slot for healing kits and the right slot for grenades and smokers), and a milky-white health bar. The weapon slot illustrations change based on the selected weapon, and next to it, the ammunition count is displayed (round ammunition left and ammunition left in the backpack). This information can be effectively used by players to their advantage. As for the equipment slots, each slot can accommodate various types of equipment, such as grenades or healing kits. Only the icon of the specific equipment being used is displayed. To use a different type of equipment, players must select the "more options" icon (depicted as an upward arrow above the equipment slot), which reveals all available equipment of the same type. Players can then choose the desired item by pressing it again. This process can be time-consuming and inefficient for quick actions, especially on smartphones, where screen size may impact performance. Although button size can be improved by switching to a larger screen, such as a tablet, or customizing the button display, it remains a drawback and disadvantage for players primarily using smartphones.

If your teammate shoots at you, or vice versa, hitbox effects occur, but the health bar for both you and your teammate does not decrease.

These design choices and elements in the game's interface, including player count display, map placement, compass, team list, action buttons, backpack icon, weapon and equipment slots, and health bar, contribute to the overall gameplay experience by providing vital information, ensuring learnability, and accommodating `human capabilities` and `user mental models`.






### In-game flight



When we begin the game, players are grouped together inside an airplane that traverses the chosen map. The flight direction of the airplane varies in each round and remains anonymous.

![pubg-flight](images/pubg-flight.jpg)

In terms of visual display, most elements remain unchanged except for the action display. Notably, there is now an extension on the player's team list located on the left-hand side, accompanied by a jump button that allows players to exit the aircraft. The jump button is represented by an illustration of a man wearing a backpack and `free-falling`. The team list extension includes a steering wheel, a follow button, and an invite button. This extension is specific to each teammate and round, indicating which section belongs to whom. The steering wheel signifies the player responsible for leading the team's exit from the aircraft and guiding their teammates to the predetermined target. By hovering a color icon over the steering wheel, the game designates the leader based on the color previously assigned. For example, if the first person assigned the color yellow is designated as the leader, a yellow icon will hover over their steering wheel.

Upon exiting the aircraft, the action display undergoes a change. Players are provided with a joystick to control the character's direction, a release button to deploy the parachute, and a column monitor that provides information about the falling speed. Through a cursor, players can determine their altitude, with the cursor moving downward as they descend. The column is divided into two sections: the transparent `free-falling` section and the milky white `danger section`. The `danger section` indicates the point at which players must deploy their parachutes to reduce their speed. If players enter this `danger area`, the game automatically deploys their parachute. This monitoring column effectively communicates the speed and altitude of the fall to players. The downward movement of the cursor provides clear information, allowing players to make precise decisions based on this specific component.

These updates in the game's action display, such as the team list extension and jump button, as well as the inclusion of the steering wheel and the monitoring column for falling speed and altitude, aim to enhance the gameplay experience and provide players with important information during their descent.
![pubg-parachuting](images/pubg-parachuting.jpg)


### Map

**Map** : What whe use to navigate through the game.

**Ring** : a circle that keeps shrinking over time.

When you open the map in the game, you are presented with longitude and latitude markers, just like a real-life map. If you prefer, you have the option to disable these markers, resulting in a less detailed map. However, one limitation is that the map does not display information about the terrain altitude, which could be useful to players who desire that information.

![pubg-map-latitude-longitude](images/map-latitude-longitude.jpg)
![pubg-map](images/map.jpg)


Regarding the ring mechanic, being outside the ring leaves you vulnerable, causing your health bar to gradually decrease. The severity of this effect worsens as the ring becomes smaller. To signify this, the game uses the color blue to indicate the vulnerable zone and the color green for the injured animation. These colors are deliberately chosen to have lower luminosity, making them distinguishable even for players who are colorblind. These color choices aim to warn players that something unfavorable is occurring.

It's worth noting that the ring warning is still displayed even when the map is minimized. For instance, a running figure icon represents your character, while a white strip on the bar indicates that you are within the safe zone. The blue section of the bar represents the vulnerable zone, which expands over time as it gets closer to your location. This feature proves beneficial for gamers, whether they are playing in big or small map mode.

![pubg-map-ring](images/map-ring.jpg)
![pubg-pubg-zone](images/pubg-zone.jpg)

These design choices in the game, such as the display of longitude and latitude on the map, the use of blue and green to represent danger and injury, and the persistent ring warning even in minimized mode, aim to provide players with essential information and enhance their gaming experience. In addition, green is opposite to the color red, represent blood, the developer trying to reduced bloodshed but still kept the severity of the effect. 


### In-game Controller

This is the complete layout of the PUBG controller in walking mode, which serves as the default controller on mobile phones. This initial layout is what users first interact with when starting the game. Although customization options are available later on, let's examine the default layout provided by the game.
![pubg-controller](images/controller.jpg)

At first glance, the layout appears quite chaotic. The top-right corner features the map, settings button, microphone access, volume control, and potentially more, depending on personal customization. The functions of the remaining buttons may require some exploration.

Let's consider the optimization of the default layout for players who typically use their thumbs while playing. One aspect that raises concerns is the sprint action. To sprint, users must drag the joystick towards the sprint button, which creates a considerable gap. This can be inefficient and lead to thumb fatigue due to excessive and out-of-range movements, as well as subsequent inaccuracies in execution.


![pubg-controller-attack-btn](images/controller-attack-btn.jpg)


Speaking of inaccuracies, the bullet icon on the left is designed to be the size of an average person's thumb when pressed against a surface. It is optimized for the game rather than the user. As players spend more time in the game, they often increase the size of this button to 150% or more to enhance their response time compared to others. This tendency arises due to the highly competitive nature of the game. However, enlarging the button results in running out of vertical space on the screen, which prompts players to find alternative ways to manage it. Some players opt for using tablets instead of mobile phones, as tablets offer more screen space. This creates an imbalance for those who continue playing on mobile phones, as tablets provide advantages in terms of quick actions and improved enemy detection rates.

![pubg-controller-kit-slot](images/controller-kit-slot.jpg)
![pubg-controller-grenade-slot](images/controller-grenade-slot.jpg)


Let's examine the two equipment slots. The health kit slot on the left appears smaller than the grenade slot on the right. This can be explained by the fact that the weight of a specific health kit can exceed that of a grenade, resulting in fewer slots being available for health kits. However, the asymmetric layout can make users feel uncomfortable. Humans tend to prefer symmetry and perfection. Therefore, it might be beneficial to adjust these two slots to have an equal size and placement.

### Game-play

#### Looting
When looting from an opponent or a teammate in PUBG, a scroll box appears on your screen. Typically, items are displayed with a white background, but if an item has a yellow background, it signifies that it is beneficial for you. 'Good' in this context means the item is either a weapon you don't have or the type of ammunition that is compatible with your current weapon.

The choice of the color yellow is based on human psychology. When people see the color yellow, it often evokes feelings of warmth and positivity. Yellow is also associated with a gold medal, symbolizing achievement and excellence. By using the color yellow, the game indirectly encourages players to feel a sense of increased odds and success, boosting their confidence in winning.

There is a game mechanism that enables quick looting. When this feature is turned on, you automatically collect all items beneficial to you from a nearby eliminated player until your backpack is full. However, if other players haven't activated this mode or are unaware of its existence, it can put them at a disadvantage, impacting their performance and the overall fairness of the game.

Let's consider a scenario: I'm using a weapon that requires green ammunition, and I've collected a significant amount of it as the game progresses. When I engage in quick looting, the mechanism keeps picking up more green ammunition, causing my backpack to fill up. I then have to manually manage my inventory or disable the mechanism, which can be quite inconvenient. To address this, I propose implementing a maximum ammunition capacity. Although the chances of collecting a large amount of ammunition are low due to the presence of other consumable items like healing kits and boost items, the issue still arises, and we should enhance the user experience of the game by finding a solution.

#### Response when you attack

Well, the response from the game is pretty good, when turning on the scope to aim, or the recoil when shooting seems to be compatible with the real-world experience. Visually it seems real, similar to real life. Can we make it more realistic, phones or tablets both have vibration mode, why don't we take advantage of it. Agree with using vibration mode will consume more battery capacity but it should be an option for gamers to choose.


### The center of the gun

The center of the gun is placed in the middle of the screen in PUBG Mobile to provide a more intuitive and natural shooting experience for players. Placing the gun's center in the middle allows for easier aiming and better hand-eye coordination during combat. When the gun's center is aligned with the middle of the screen, it creates a consistent reference point for aiming. This means that players can develop muscle memory and a sense of aim without having to constantly adjust their aim based on the gun's position on the screen. Makes it easier to track and target enemies. Since most of the action and opponents are located in the center of the screen, having the gun's center aligned with it allows for quicker and more accurate targeting. PUBG Mobile is played on various mobile devices with different screen sizes and aspect ratios. Placing the gun's center in the middle ensures that the aiming reference point remains consistent across different devices, promoting fair and equal gameplay for all players. Pubg tend to hold tight to the gaming convention of placing the center of the gun is placed in the middle of the screen 

By positioning the gun's center in the middle of the screen, PUBG Mobile aims to optimize the shooting mechanics, enhance the player's aiming capabilities, and provide a more user-friendly experience overall.

## Hints and Tips

For new players, who will be unfamiliar with the layout and the functionality of the buttons, the game provides hints to guide them through the interface. 

![pubg-hint](images/pubg-hint.jpg)

For example, when players first open the game, a hint will appear on the "Start" button to encourage them to start the game, or in the picture below, there's a hint pointing at the "Newbie" button,

![pubg-hint](images/pubg-newbie-hints.jpg)

or various banners that appear throughout the game to notify players of new features or events.

![pubg-banner](images/pubg-banner-1.jpg)

These notifications will usually take up most of the screen to catch the player's attention, notifying them of new features or events. For instance, the shop will present latest items that are available for purchase as the main spotlight of the screen, while the background is dimmed so that it will not cause any distractions. Other items are also designed to be well contrasted and visually appealing to attract the player's attention, and potentially, to encourage them to purchase the items.

![pubg-shop](images/pubg-shop.jpg)

Moreover, the game also have popup notifications that appear when players complete a mission or an achievement. Or, when the players accidentally click on "dangerous" buttons, like the "Buy" button in the shop, or the "Upgrade" button in the inventory, or when the players want to exit the match, there will be a popup notification to confirm their action. This thoroughness is a good design to reduce the amount of errors that players might make.

![pubg-exit-match](images/pubg-exit-match.jpg)


## Visualization

The game comes with visual effects to enhance the user experience. For instance, when players want to view the details of an item, there will be a 3D model next to the side to give the players a more realistic view of the item, how it looks like, how it fits to their character models, etc. The 3D model also has the ability to rotate, allowing players to view the item from different angles. This feature is another special thing about the game because they can view all the perks and details of the item right in the game itself, instead of having to go online for reference.

![pubg-visualize](images/pubg-visualization.jpg)

## Personalization

The ingame settings are rich and diverse, allowing players to customize the game to their liking. For example, players can adjust the graphics quality, frame rate, and resolution to optimize performance. They can also customize the controls, button layout, sensitivity, crosshair, and other gameplay settings to suit their preferences. These personalization options allow players to tailor the game, and increases memorability as they can configure the game to match their individual playstyle and needs.

![pubg-settings-1](/images/pubg-settings-1.jpg)

![pubg-settings-2](/images/pubg-settings-2.jpg)

There is one thing to consider, however, is that the personalization options cannot fit all the players' needs. The developers have tried their best to include the most common options that players would want to customize. Doing this will cause an absurd amount of options and it will be unnecessary. An example of this is the limited color options for the crosshair,

![pubg-settings-3](images/pubg-settings-3.jpg)

or the limited languages supported by the game.

![pubg-settings-4](/images/pubg-settings-4.jpg)

## Gameplay

### Loading Screen

![pubg-loading](images/pubg-loading-screen.jpg)

The loading screen is well-thought-out and designed to be visually appealing, while also gives players some insights of the gameplay and the chosen map. For instance, the background is a screenshot of the map environment (dimmed) to give players a sense of the gameplay. In the foreground is a big splashscreen of important mechanics of the game, like the "Danger Zone" or the "Red Zone", visualized with images and text to give players a better ease of understanding. 

Moreover, it also offers tooltips, prompts, and contextual information. These resources can aid players in refreshing their memory on specific features or mechanics when needed.

There is also a loading bar at the bottom of the screen to show the progress of the loading.  


### 2.3.1. Perception

PUBG Mobile leverages players' perceptual abilities, including visual and auditory perception. Visual perception is crucial for spotting opponents, identifying resources, and navigating the game world. The game's graphics and visual cues provide important information about the environment, such as terrain, structures, and object interactions. Auditory perception allows players to locate opponents based on sound cues, such as footsteps, gunshots, or vehicle sounds. PUBG Mobile engages players' perceptual abilities to enhance situational awareness and decision-making.

### 2.3.2. Cognition

PUBG minimize the user’s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

The weapons and bullets have different types in the PUBG mobile and players feel difficult to figure out what they need at that time. The highlighted stuff is an automatic reminder for players to recognize the weapon they have and what bullets they should pick up.

![pubg-image-1](images/pubg-cognition.png)

## 2.4. User Mental Model

### 2.4.1. Real-world References

PUBG Mobile incorporates real-world references to enhance the user experience and facilitate learning. The game draws inspiration from real-world military tactics, weapons, and equipment. This allows players to leverage their existing knowledge and understanding of these concepts to improve their performance in the game. For example, players can apply real-world knowledge of weapon characteristics, such as recoil and bullet drop, to improve their aim and accuracy in PUBG Mobile.

PUBG Mobile also incorporates real-world references in its user interface. For example, the inventory system is designed to mimic a backpack, allowing players to organize and manage their items in a way that is familiar and intuitive. Similarly, the map interface resembles a paper map, providing a recognizable and intuitive way to navigate the game world.



### 2.4.2. Familiarity with Battle Royale Genre and Gaming Conventions

PUBG Mobile is a battle royale game, and many players are already familiar with the genre.

**Complexity Overload:** PUBG Mobile offers a wide range of gameplay mechanics, features, and strategies, which can be overwhelming for new players. The complexity of the game may lead to a steep learning curve, making it challenging for beginners to grasp all the nuances quickly.

**Lack of In-Depth Explanations:** While PUBG Mobile provides a tutorial and tooltips, some players may find that the explanations provided are not detailed enough. In-depth explanations about advanced tactics, weapon statistics, or complex game mechanics may be lacking, leaving players to seek information from external sources.

**Language Barriers:** PUBG Mobile is played by a global audience, and language barriers can pose challenges for players who are not fluent in the game's default language. In some cases, translations may not be accurate or may be incomplete, leading to confusion and difficulty in understanding instructions and tooltips.


**Time Investment:** PUBG Mobile is a complex game that requires a significant time investment to become proficient. Some players may find it difficult to dedicate the necessary time to learn and improve their skills, which can impede their progress and enjoyment of the game.

**Lack of Adaptive Learning:** PUBG Mobile currently does not have a sophisticated adaptive learning system that tailors the learning experience to individual players' needs. While the tutorial and practice modes provide a general foundation, the game does not adapt its guidance based on players' specific strengths, weaknesses, or preferred learning styles.

### 2.5.2. Efficiency

#### Good Points

**Navigation Speed:**: Players can quickly navigate through menus, settings, and in-game interfaces to access various features and options (such as where to start the match, friend list, shops, battle pass, ...). Everything is scattered around the edge of the screen to give your in-game character the highlight. Also,  there is always an Exit button on the top right to undo action and exit the dialogue.

![pubg-image-4](images/pubg-navigation.png)

**Effective Looting and Inventory Management:**

Players can easily perform actions such as swapping items between their inventory and the ground, dropping items from their inventory, or picking up items from the ground with the auto-pickup feature. Players just need to tap on the item they want to pick up and the item will be automatically added to their inventory. The auto-pickup feature can be customized to prioritize certain items over others, allowing players to quickly collect the items they need.

PUBG Mobile typically offers options to sort and filter the inventory based on different criteria such as item type, rarity, and quantity. This helps players quickly find and manage specific items. By selecting an item in the inventory, players can access additional information about that item, such as its stats, attachments compatibility, and any customization options available.

![pubg-inventory](images/image-pubg-2.png)

#### Drawbacks and Hindrances

The drawback lies in the space in which the user interacts with the game, and server connection speed will depend on many factors such as network speed, which device to use to play the game.

**Overloaded Interaction Space:**

One of the main drawbacks is the crowded interaction space in PUBG Mobile. While players typically use only 2-4 fingers to interact with the game, there are more than 20 buttons available for interaction. This overload of buttons can overwhelm users and impede their ability to perform actions swiftly and accurately.

-	**Solution:** Customizable Controller Interface
To enhance the user experience, a potential solution is to provide users with the ability to customize their controller interface. By allowing users to personalize the placement and number of buttons according to their preferences and gameplay style, the interaction space can be optimized. However, it should be noted that customization may result in the transfer of the problem to other aspects, as reducing buttons may limit certain movements or actions.

![pubg-fingers](images/pubg-fingers.jpg)

**Load-time and Matchmaking:**

The time it takes to find a match in each map in PUBG MOBILE can vary depending on several factors, including the region, time of day, and the player’s rank. On average, it typically takes around 30 seconds to a few minutes to find a match in popular maps such as Erangel, Miramar, Sanhok, and Vikendi. However, less popular or newer maps may take longer to find a match. Additionally, the time it takes to find a match can vary depending on the player’s rank. Higher-ranked players may experience longer matchmaking times due to the smaller pool of players available at their skill level.

**Lag and Frame Rate Issues:**

Lag and frame rate issues can occur in PUBG MOBILE due to a variety of factors, including network connectivity, device performance, and graphics settings. These issues can negatively impact the user experience by causing delays in gameplay, making it difficult to aim accurately, or resulting in crashes or disconnections.

This means that similar actions and interactions are represented in a uniform way across different screens and menus. For example, the placement of buttons, icons, and menu structures remain consistent, making it easier for users to remember how to navigate and interact within the game.

- **Help and Support:** The game offers in-game help and support features, including tooltips, prompts, and contextual information. These resources can aid players in refreshing their memory on specific features or mechanics when needed.

- **Personalized Settings:** PUBG MOBILE allows users to customize their settings, including controls, sensitivity, and UI elements. By giving players the ability to tailor the game experience to their preferences, it increases memorability as they can configure the game to match their individual playstyle and needs.

![pubg-settings](images/pubg-settings.png)

- **Visual Cues and Feedback:** PUBG MOBILE incorporates visual cues and feedback to reinforce actions and provide information to the player. This can include highlighting interactive elements, displaying status indicators, and providing visual and audio feedback when actions are performed successfully. These cues help users remember the effects of their actions and understand the outcome of their interactions.

- **Visual Hierarchy:** PUBG MOBILE applies visual hierarchy to highlight important elements and information. By using size, color, contrast, and spacing effectively, the interface guides users' attention to key elements, making them more memorable and easier to locate and interact with in the future.

By focusing on consistent design patterns, intuitive controls, helpful onboarding, personalized settings, visual cues, and feedback, PUBG MOBILE aims to enhance the memorability of the user interface. This, in turn, improves the overall user experience by reducing the cognitive load on players and enabling them to quickly recall how to interact with the game even after periods of inactivity.

### 2.5.4. Errors

Errors in usability refer to instances where users encounter difficulties or make mistakes while interacting with the user interface. Identifying and addressing these usability errors is crucial for improving the overall user experience. Here are some common usability errors that can occur in PUBG MOBILE:

**Inconsistent Controls:**

- Changing control schemes or button mappings without clear indication or explanation, causing confusion and errors in gameplay.
- Variation in control sensitivity or responsiveness across different sections of the game, leading to inconsistent user experiences and potential errors.

For example, there are three main situations that need direction control: the landing, the walking, and the driving page. Players can figure out the direction control button on the left (the rocker pad). Pubg mobile provided the rocker pad to control directions in landing, walking status. But the directional pad of driving is directional pads with horizontal and vertical pads on two sides. The direction control is inconsistent with those three main situations. Thus, players need more effort to learn how to perform in the driving situation. As for the opportunity to improve, Pubg mobile can also provide more customized options on control layout of status.

![pubg-layout-change](images/pubg-btn-layout-2.png)

**Poor Button Placement:**

- Placing critical buttons, such as the fire button or grenade throw button, too close together, resulting in accidental taps or erroneous actions.
