# 1. Aim and Objectives

The aim of this report is to evaluate and analyse the user experience of two products:

1. [Ziiiro Watch](https://www.ziiiro.com/)
2. [PUBG Mobile](https://www.pubgmobile.com/en-US/home.shtml)

The report focuses on the analysis of user experience and experience perspectives based on the fundemental HCI concepts that have been covered in the HCI course, which includes:

- Human capabilities
- User mental model
- Interaction metaphor
- Usability

## In-game Experience
### In-game waiting lobby

Firstly, the game will start when there is 100 players available (ready to connect). You can see when there is enough player by monitoring the top-left corner. It'll show how many player exist in the room.

Then when the game begins, it'll change to how many players still survive. And how many did you eliminated.

Why is it must be at the top-left corner. Well, as to many gaming convention, things that is important to the user or in another saying player need to know should be noticed by players are put at the top.

Following that we'll have the map at the top-right corner, as well as the settings button, micro phone access, volume access,... And it can be more due to personal customization.

Then you will, have a minimize compass in the middle-top. This will help players navigate through the map whether they're heading in the right direction. By communiocating to each others, teammate can tell other what direction is the enemies by signify the number on the compass and which direction (Nord, South, West, East) just like in the real world. This will satisfied the `Human Capabilities` in both perception and cognition as well as the `User Mental Model`. In `usability`, user don't have to learn how to use it because it's base on an real-world object, the compass, so it will satisfied the `learnability` in `usability`

Continue the left corner, we'll have 4 members of our team, to display these member info, we'll have you at the top (signify the person who playing), than the others as follow. They'll have their in-game spell together with a color tags to signal their teammate not to shoot at them. 

By tagging each member as a color symbol, will help players don't have to remember teammates name but as a color tag (`Human Capabilities`).

At the bottom-right corner, base on the default display, there're some button perform action like: `attack, jump, crawl, kneel`. For each button there will be a clear illustration for that specific action. However, the attack button will change depend on what type of weapon you're wielding: none - fist, guns - bullet, melee-weapons - knife. For experience gamer, this will signify them clearly what's that button will do if they press it. For new-gamer, the illustration is clear enough for them to know the usage of those buttons.

At the bottom-left corner, players have a joy-stick icon to control their charater. The concept of joy-stick is very old, back in 1960, so obviously every body know what is it and what's does. 

Next to it we will have another attack button. Why is it there because we already have an attack button on the right. Well, in case the player want to jump and shooting (attack) simultaneously, their right thump pressed the jump button and the other one pressed attack. To answer the question, in some cases, players want to perform two action at the same time, in case they run out of finger to press in one side, the game place the same button in the other side to assist players. This also can be change in the customization section where players can custom their personal action display which suit them best.

Next up is the backpack icon. For it's called, you already know what is it.
The icon also illustration its storage size, there a circle running around the button. It's signify the backpack capacity, is it full or not, how much storage space is left just like a loading icon in real-world context. However, players can't know the exact amount of storage in it. To be exact, it suppose to have a percentage info to demonstrate the amount of slot in have. But that is not the case of this game. In addition, the packback icon can show which tier it is (the rarity) by showing some yellow stripes next to it, more stripes it have, the better the quality (`User Mental Model`).

At the bottom line you'll have 2 weapons slot, 2 equipment slots (on the left side is the slot for heal kit, on the right is for grenade, smoker,...) and your health bar in milky-white. The weapons slot will change the illustration base on what weapon you choose and next to it is the amount of ammunition you have left-hand side (ammunition left in a round / ammunition left in the backpack). This is quite clear for any person to use this info as their advantage. As for the equipment slot, every kind of heal kit or grenade is pack into a single slot. This mean if you're using grenade, only the grenade icon will be display, if you want to use another kind of equipment, let say a smoker, you have to choose the more option icon (as a up-arrow over the equipment slot) then it will display every equipment you have which has the same type, then you select the kit and pressed it again in order to use it. Well this is time consuming and ineffective to the players if they want to do a quick action. In addition, if user is using a smart phone to play, the size of it might effect the performance of its user. Althoughts, the size of display button can be improved by converting to a bigger screen (from phone to a tablet) or by customizing the button display.
However it's still a drawback and a disadvantage of players who mainly play this game throught a their smart phone.

If your teammate shoot at you or vice versa, there are still hit box effects but you and your teammate health bar won't decreases.


### In-game flight
Starting the game, we players are packed in an air plane which flight across the map that we choose, the flight direction is anonymous each round.

For the visual display, most of it's unchange but for the action display.
In addition, now we have an extension on the player's team list on left-hand side as well as a jump button to exit the aircraft (with an illustration of a man free falling who wearing a backpack). The extension include a stearing wheel, a follow button, an invite button. The extension section is set to each teammate, each round. So it signify that those new section belongs to whom. The stearing show who is in charge of leaving the aircraft and landed their teammate at the predetermined target. By hovering a color icon over the stearing wheel, it telling who is the leader according to the color previously marked by the game. For exemple: if you assign the first person whose color is yellow to be the leader, your stearing wheel will have a yellow icon hovering over it.

When we exit the teh action display change, we will have a joy stick to controll the character direction, a release button to pull out the parachute, a column monitor to give us info about our fall speed, throught a cursor we can know what is our altitude, the cursor will move downward as we falling. The column has 2 section: section where we can `free falling` is marked as transparent, `danger section`, marked as milky white, is where we must pull out the parachute to decrease our speed, if the players enter this danger area, the game automatically pull out the player parachute. This monitoring column perfectly exucute how the game inform the user on speed and altitude of their fall. The way the cursor move downward as we fall give the user a clear info and the usage of this specific component.

### Map

**Map** : What whe use to navigate through the game.

**Ring** : a circle that keeps shrinking over time.

When opening the map we get the longitude and latitude, just like our real life map. If you don't feel like it, you can turn it off. You will get a less clearer map. However, the map cannot show the terrain altitude. That is a drawback cause user might wanted to have that info.

About the ring, when you are outside the ring you will be vulnerable and your health bar decreases over time. The smaller the ring, the worse it gets. To signify that the game using color blue to alert the vulnerable zone, and the color green to do the injured animation. These colors have a lower luminosity than the others even for colorblind people.
It try to warn that something bad is happening.

The ring warning is still displayed when the map is minimize.
Exemple:

<!-- picture -->

The of a person is running figure represent your character. The white strip mean you reach the end of this bar. You are in the safe zone. The blue section is the vulnerable zone. It will increase overtime as it get closer to you. This is a great feature for gamers, both on big and small map mode.
