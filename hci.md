*Use case*: In a diverse professional setting, the ZIIIRO watch's visual clarity proves valuable. Professionals such as engineers, designers, and architects can easily glance at the watch during meetings without being distracted by unnecessary details. This allows them to maintain focus, adhere to schedules, and seamlessly transition between tasks. The minimalist design adds sophistication to their attire, making it a subtle fashion statement.

Whether they are attending parties, social events, or simply want to stand out in their day-to-day activities, the watch serves as a conversation starter and complements their personal style choices.

**Drawbacks**:

- **Learning Curve**: Due to its unconventional interface, users may initially find it challenging to understand how to read the time on the ZIIIRO watch. It deviates from the traditional watch face format, requiring users to learn a new time-telling method. This learning curve can be a drawback for users who prefer familiarity and ease of use.
*Use case*: Elderly users who are accustomed to traditional watch designs and may have difficulty adapting to new technologies could find the learning curve of the ZIIIRO watch challenging. Its unconventional interface might cause confusion and frustration for individuals who are used to reading time in a more traditional manner.

- **Precision and Accuracy**: The abstract representation of time on the ZIIIRO watch sacrifices precise timekeeping. The absence of minute and second markers makes it difficult to determine time with high accuracy. While the watch may suffice for general timekeeping, it may not be suitable for situations that require precise timing.
*Use case*: Sports and fitness enthusiasts who require precise timing for activities such as interval training, timing laps, or monitoring rest periods may find the abstract time representation of the ZIIIRO watch insufficient. The lack of minute and second markers makes it difficult to track time precisely, potentially impacting their performance or training routines

- **Limited Functionality**: The ZIIIRO watch's interface focuses solely on displaying the time. It lacks additional features commonly found in modern watches, such as date display, alarms, or timers. Users who require these functionalities may find the ZIIIRO watch limited in its capabilities.
*Use case*: Travelers who rely on watches to not only tell time but also track multiple time zones or use alarms to manage their schedules may find the limited functionality of the ZIIIRO watch inconvenient. The absence of additional features like date display, world time, or alarms may hinder their ability to efficiently manage their travel plans or stay organized in different time zones.

- **Accessibility**: The abstract representation of time on the ZIIIRO watch may pose challenges for individuals with visual impairments or certain cognitive disabilities. The lack of clear, standardized time indicators can hinder accessibility for a portion of the user population.
*Use case*: Visually impaired users who heavily rely on tactile or audible feedback to interact with devices may find the abstract time representation of the ZIIIRO watch inaccessible. The lack of clear indicators or tactile markings makes it difficult for these users to independently read and interpret the time, potentially excluding them from using the watch effectively.

5. Different types of users who might use this application, possible contexts where difficulties and hinderances might occur with the given interfaces and interactions that the products current provide.

- **Tech Novices**:
Users who are not accustomed to modern technology or have limited experience with digital devices may face difficulties understanding and operating the ZIIIRO watch's unconventional interface. The abstract representation of time may be confusing, leading to a steep learning curve for these users.

- **Elderly Users**:
Elderly users who are more accustomed to traditional watches with standard time displays may find it challenging to adapt to the abstract time representation used in the ZIIIRO watch. The lack of clear minute and second markers could lead to confusion and difficulty accurately reading the time.

- **Visually Impaired Users**:
Visually impaired users who rely on clear and tactile indicators to read time may encounter difficulties with the ZIIIRO watch's interface. The absence of standardized markings or tactile feedback could hinder their ability to independently interpret the time.

- **Users in Time-Critical Situations**:
In time-critical situations where precise timing is crucial, such as sports events or professional settings with strict deadlines, the abstract representation of time on the ZIIIRO watch might not provide the accuracy and precision needed. The lack of minute and second markers could make it challenging for users to track time precisely.

- **Multitaskers**:
Users who frequently rely on additional functions, such as alarms, timers, or date displays, may find the limited functionality of the ZIIIRO watch restrictive. In contexts where managing multiple tasks and schedules is essential, the absence of these features may hinder their productivity and organizational abilities.

- **Individuals with Cognitive Disabilities**:
